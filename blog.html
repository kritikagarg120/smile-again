				Smile Again application’s main objective is to make old age people group (nearby) and make them happy
				and
				feel less lonely. This will try to help them to come out from their negative feelings by interacting

				mental
				illness that generally can be spotted after some age, and this will be really helpful for the people who
				live alone. It is an opportunity for retired people or people who are not living with their children or
				living in old age home to smile again.
