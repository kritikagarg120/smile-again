<body>
    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1><br>
    <p>Please read all the given terms and conditions very carefully</p>
    <p>Intellectual Property disclosure will inform users that the contents, logo and other visual media you
        created
        is your property and is protected by copyright laws.<br>
        2.A Termination clause will inform that users' accounts on your website and mobile app or users' access to your
        website and mobile (if users can't have an account with you) can be terminated in case of abuses or at your sole
        discretion.<br>
        3.A Governing Law will inform users which laws govern the agreement. This should the country in which your
        company
        is headquartered or the country from which you operate your website and mobile app.<br>
        4.A Links To Other Web Sites clause will inform users that you are not responsible for any third party websites
        that you link to. This kind of clause will generally inform users that they are responsible for reading and
        agreeing (or disagreeing) with the Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policies of these third parties.<br>
        5.If your website or mobile app allows users to create content and make that content public to other users, a
        Content section will inform users that they own the rights to the content they have created. The "Content"
        clause usually mentions that users must give you (the website or mobile app developer) a license so that you can
        share this content on your website/mobile app and to make it available to other users.<br>

        Because the content created by users is public to other users, a DMCA notice clause (or Copyright Infringement )
        section is helpful to inform users and copyright authors that, if any content is found to be a copyright
        infringement, you will respond to any DMCA takedown notices received and you will take down the content.<br>

        6.A Limit What Users Can Do clause can inform users that by agreeing to use your service, they're also agreeing
        to
        not do certain things. This can be part of a very long and thorough list in your Terms and Conditions agreements
        so as to encompass the most amount of negative uses.<br>
        <h5>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h5>

        You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be
        governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
        conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal
        courts in Santa Clara County, Californa, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding
        provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a
        consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside. Any
        claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such
        claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods
        and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than
        out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. In the
        event of any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the
        Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to
        resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time the thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such
        controversy or dispute to mediation. It dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be
        free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.<br>
